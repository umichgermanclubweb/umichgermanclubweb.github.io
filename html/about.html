<h2> About German Club at the University of Michigan</h2>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>
    German Club's mission is to unite students with a passion for German
    language and culture by providing opportunities for language practice,
    cultural events, networking, and learning about German culture in
    America, German-speaking countries, and around the world.
</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
    Every week during the academic year, German Club holds a <strong>Stammtisch</strong> (conversation night) where students
    of all levels have the opportunity to meet new friends and practice their spoken German.
    Other common events include <strong>Filmabend</strong> (movie night) where we watch a German movie or <em>Fernsehsendung</em> (TV show),
    <strong>Spielabend</strong> (game night) where we play German board games and games in German, and <strong>Metzger's Dinner</strong> where
    we eat dinner at the German restaurant <a href="https://www.metzgers.net/">Metzger's</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Some annual events include the <strong>Weltmeisterschaft</strong> (World Cup) soccer tournament
    among University of Michigan language and culture clubs in September and
    <strong>Brezelabend</strong> (pretzel night) where we enjoy an evening of baking and
    eating German pretzels.
</p>
<p>
    In the past, we've also had events focused on careers, <em>Lebenslauf</em> (r&eacute;sum&eacute;),
    and opportunities with German. The Leadership Committee plans a special event
    in the Winter semester, and German Club is always open to trying out new events
    aimed at improving members' cultural understanding and providing them
    with opportunities to connect with other German speakers and practice their spoken German.
